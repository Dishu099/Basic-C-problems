THEORY OF QUEUE:
QUEUE: Queue is basically a FIFO Data Structure(First in first out).
        Using Queue we see the element present at the end.
        There are three operations:
    1.)PUSH OPERATION: We can insert the element in the end.
    2.)POP OERATION: We can remove the element from the front.
    3.)FRONT OPERATION:We can see the front element while using this operation.
