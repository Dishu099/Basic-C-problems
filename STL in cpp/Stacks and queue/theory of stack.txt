THEORY OF STACK:
STACK:  Stack is basically a LIFO (last in first out).
        Using stacks we access only the top element.
        We can also access the size of the element.
        There are three operations:
    1.)PUSH OPERATION: We can insert the element from the top.
    2.)POP OPERATION: We can remove the element from the top.
    3.)TOP OPERATION: In this operation we can see the top element of the stack.
